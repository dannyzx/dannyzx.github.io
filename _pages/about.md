My research journey is driven by a passion to develop  mathematical models and algorithms, harnessing the power of machine learning and operations research to address real-world problems.

Currently as a Research Fellow at Duke-NUS Medical School, I am deeply immersed in advancing AI for healthcare applications. 

I hold a PhD in Operations Research from Sapienza, the University of Rome, with a focus on global optimization algorithms. During that time, I was working at the Institute of Marine Engineering at the National Research Council of Italy developing machine learning and deep learning approaches for solving challenges in fluid dynamics.

I undertook an internship at Huawei Ireland Research Centre during my PhD, engaging with timeseries clustering and causal inference. 

I joined the National University of Singapore for a postdoc, under the supervision of Prof. Christine Annette Shoemaker. Here, my research focused explainable AI and supervised dimensionality reduction.

As an Italian hailing from Rome, football has been more than a game - it's been a lifelong passion that I've honed through years of team play. Beyond academia, I find solace in strumming the electric guitar, reading books and perfecting the art of cooking, with Italian cuisine holding a special place in my heart.

<!--- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. --->>
